Lending Club Loan Repayment Prediction Model

## Overview
The Lending Club Loan Repayment Prediction Model is a machine learning model that aims to predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan in full, based on the available data. The model is built using publicly available data from LendingClub.com, a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers with investors.

## Data Source
We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the CSV file already provided.

## Project Goals
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts whether borrowers on LendingClub.com will fully repay their loans. To achieve this, lending data from 2007-2010 will be used to classify and predict if the borrower repaid the loan in full. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering and selection, and building a predictive model using Python and popular machine learning libraries. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to make predictions from data, and how to approach a classification problem using Python. The outcome of this project will help investors make better investment decisions and reduce their risk of losses.
